          	<h3>Carebit</h3>
            <div class="row">
            	<img src="carebit.png">
            	<div class="col">
              		<p>Technologies Used: Java, Android Studio, Github</p>
              		<p>Carebit is an Android/iOS proof of concept app that my senior design team developed over the course of several months. I personally worked on the Android app with one other developer and learned a lot about how Android works and how apps should be designed in Android Studio.<br>  The purpose of the app was to use the Fitbit APIs that Fitbit provides to make a caregiving app that could be utilized by both the caregiver and the person being cared for. To do this we setup a backend using Python Flask where we could store the data given by the Fitbit API so we could avoid making an amount of calls excess to what Fitbit allowed. With our backend buit we were then able to start joint development of both the Android/Java app and the iOS/Swift app. For the caregiver side we provided a detailed dashboard that displayed the information taked from the caregivee's fitbit as well as some detailed notification settings and for the caregivee side we provided a much simpler interface with a few privacy settings and a simple chat feature for both sides to message eachother.</p>

          	<h3>Recursive Descent Compiler</h3>
            <div class="row">
            	<div class="col">
            		<p>Technologies Used: C, Pl/0 (syntax), Bash Scripting, GDB</p>
              		<p>This project is one of my longest projects code-wise. It is a recursive descent compiler for the archaic language PL/0 which conviently has a simple extended Backus-Naur form (ENBF) or, in other words, it is formally described as a language in a discrete sense and therefore we can write a ton of recursion off of its definition to build a simple compiler. This project involved 3 things.</p>
              		<ol>
		                <li><p>Writing a virtual machine to interpret our generated PL/0 assembly</p></li>
		                <li><p>Tokanizing the input file and building the symbol table</p></li>
		                <li><p>Running the list of tokens thru the formal language definition to determine if the syntax was valid and also to generate the assembly instructions required to do what the code says</p></li>
              		</ol>
              		<p>The reasion why this school project is included is due to how tedious these processes were to actually implement. I had to become somewhat proficient in GDB which is the command line C debugger and I also had to build test scripts using bash to run thru multiple files and to verify if my program was working correctly. Unit testing, if you will.</p>

              <h3>UCF Innovation Lab App</h3>
              <p>Technologies Used: NativeScript, Typescript, XML, MySQL</p>
              <p>This was one of my first attempts to build an app. It was for a beginning object oriented design class and thru the research I had to do for the project I learned a lot about what technologies are being used today in the market. It was very challenging due to everything being new and in hindsight we chose not the best technology stack and perhaps were too ambitious for just starting. We achived the minimal viable product and had something to show for our efforts but in the future I was much more careful about choosing stacks.</p>
